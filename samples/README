This script performs the pangenome analysis for all genes of a given genome.

Input is two binary files, one encoding gene presence/absence profiles,
and another containing profile masks representing the comparison genome set.

Format is:

unsigned long PROFILE_ARRAY_SIZE   //number of unsigned long values in array
unsigned long PROFILE_FRAME_COUNT  //number of unsigned longs per profile (eg: profiles > 1 unsigned long are split between 2 or more)
unsigned long PROFILE_ELEMENT_1_FRAME_1_OF_x    // where x = PROFILE_FRAME_COUNT
unsigned long PROFILE_ELEMENT_?_FRAME_?_OF_?
...

Profile binary data files will be architecture dependent.
